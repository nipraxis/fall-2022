## About the course

See [the main course page](https://nipraxis.org) for an overall description of
the course, including a rough schedule of classes.

## About this iteration

This is the first full version of the course.  We have already run a pilot
version of the course, and we have taught versions of this course previously
in Berkeley â€” see [the about page](about#resources).

## When will it be?

The Fall course will run from the week starting 8th August 2022, through to the end of September.

## How much does it cost?

The course is completely free.

## How much time will it take?

We ask you to commit yourself to:

* 8 weeks, from the 8th August through the end of September 2022.
* 1 hour per week of independent study, either reading or videos.
* Two 2 hour live sessions on Zoom
* 1-2 hours per week of homework / group work.

That's 6-7 hours per week for 8 weeks.

## How do I join?

Please contact one of the instructors by email - see the [staff page](staff).

We would like you to join in groups of around 3.  We believe this will help
your learning and engagement with the course; you will learn a lot from each
other, as well as from the course.

So, if you can, find your group before you email, and email on behalf of your
group, Cc'ing your group members.  If you can't find a group, don't worry too
much, we will try and find you a group to work with.

For our planning, in your email, please also let us know your level of experience in:

* Coding in general
* Python coding in particular
* Neuroimaging
