## About the course

See [the main course page](https://nipraxis.org) for an overall
description of the course, including the requirements, and a rough
schedule of classes.

## About this iteration

This is the first full version of the course.  We have already run a
pilot version of the course, and we have taught versions of this
course previously in Berkeley â€” see [the about page](about#resources).

## When will it be?

The Fall course will run from the week starting 8th August 2022, through to the end of September.

## How much does it cost?

The course is completely free.

## How much time will it take?

We ask you to commit yourself to:

* 8 weeks, from the 8th August through the end of September 2022.
* 1 hour per week of independent study, either reading or videos.
* Two 2 hour live sessions on Zoom
* 1-2 hours per week of homework / group work.

That's 6-7 hours per week for 8 weeks.

## Prerequisites

For the upcoming version of the Nipraxis course, we will assume that you *either*:

* Have a reasonable working knowledge of Python and the Numpy array
  library for Python, or
* Have a good knowledge of another array programming language, such as
  Matlab or R, and you are willing to work a bit harder at the start of the course, to catch up on the Python you need.

In particular, we will expect you to know about:

* Using arrays (matrices in Matlab)
* [for loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop)
* Writing your own functions on Python, or Matlab / R.

You will find the course easier if you have done some brain imaging
analysis before, but that is not a requirement.

## How do I join?

See below for more detail - but you join by [filling in the form](
https://forms.gle/R7ggZGrqSNhgRSGn9).

We would like you to join in groups of around 3.  We believe this will
help your learning and engagement with the course; you will learn a
lot from each other, as well as from the course.

So, if you can, find your group before you fill in the form, and fill
the form in, on behalf of your group.  If you can't find a group,
don't worry too much, we will try and find you a group to work with.

If you have any questions, or you have any problems forming a group,
please contact one of the instructors by email - see the [staff
page](staff).
