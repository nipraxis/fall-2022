I am an associate professor at McGill University, Montréal, and
have been working on brain imaging methods and reproducibility
for much of my long career in the field.  I have a longstanding
interest, and a lot experience, in teaching, and have co-taught
earlier versions of this course with Matthew at Berkeley.
