I am an associate professor at McGill University, Montr√©al, and
have been working on brain imaging methods and reproducibility
for much of my long career in the field.  I have a longstanding
interest in teaching methods of brain imaging, and have
co-taught earlier versions of this course with Matthew at
Berkeley.
